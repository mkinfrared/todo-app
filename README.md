## To launch the project in dev mode

Rename the ``.env.example`` into ``.env``. I kept the original URL when I was developing the project. You can go ahead and use that I'll keep that database working for next month or you can link your own Firebase URL.

After that run

### `yarn`
### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
